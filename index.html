<h3>
    What about Flash support at 2021?
</h3>
<p>
    If you don't know yet, Google will disable Flash support in Chrome browsers
    in December 2020. In this regard, we decided to upload games only in the
    new HTML 5 format (JavaScript and WebGL). Unfortunately, many popular
    unblocked games are still written in Flash, but the developers are trying
to transfer them to HTML 5, so titles like Run 3 or Happy Wheels will
    definitely be replaced with new versions and will continue to work on our
    site!
</p>
<p>
    All games that we publish are thoroughly tested, so you can be sure that
    you will only get a positive experience. We also constantly check popular
    sites like Google Sites and Weebly for new and cool unblocked games.
</p>
<p>
    If you want to publish a new game, write to us by email and we will
    consider your request. By the way, if you liked some kind of game, then do
    not forget to like it!
